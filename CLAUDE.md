# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

ScaleAgileTestTaker - A new project repository that has just been initialized. The codebase structure and technology stack are yet to be established.

## Current State

This is a fresh repository with minimal content:
- Basic README.md with project name only
- Git repository initialized
- No source code, build configuration, or dependencies yet established

## Development Setup

No development commands or build processes have been established yet. When setting up the project structure, typical commands to establish would include:
- Package manager initialization (npm init, pip requirements.txt, etc.)
- Build and test commands
- Linting and formatting setup
- Development server commands

## Notes for Future Development

- Technology stack and architecture decisions are pending
- Project structure and organization patterns need to be established
- Development workflow and tooling choices need to be made
